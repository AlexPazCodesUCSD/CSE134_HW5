    info="One of my recent career ideas is becoming a CS teacher for K-12. I would love to teach the youth Computer Science the same way my CS teachers taught me, which led me to where I am today. In my pursuits I have taken three courses on CS teaching (CSE 198, EDS 124AR, EDS 124BR). In CSE 198, I got to make a lesson plan introducing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for K-12 students. I even got to teach K-12 students my lesson plan, which was amazing to see my work get to the students."

    <personal-card 
    title="Game Development"
    info="I love the idea of programming games on the side. I have been interested in starting a mobile game project in the near future for example. The idea of a fun little mobile game to pass the time and share with my friends sounds so exciting. More ambitious ideas involves developing a small JRPG for a game jam, practicing developing music, art, and game mechanics in small exercises. I have a history in game development through working with friends on a small JRPG, however it didn't last too long. However I got to work on art, game mechanics, and was creating concepts for the music."
