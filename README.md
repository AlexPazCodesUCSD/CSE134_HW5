# Enhancements:
## 1. Due to this assignment adding a lot of javascript-heavy code, I opted to include noscript text to alert users who have javascript turned off that the content, form, or button they wish to use is not appearing or working.
## 2. I worked on my personal page to get rid of a broken search form, and in a past commit I actually redid the content to be created through custom-element cards much like the project-card used in professional page. 
## 3. I removed the experiment page as it was no longer necessary.
